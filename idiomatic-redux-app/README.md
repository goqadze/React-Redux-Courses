# Todo App using React and Redux
Todo app using React and Redux based on Dan Abramov's next video
[course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) 

It starts with the example app that is a part of original redux examples.

# Installation

To install dependencies run this command with node installed :

```
npm install
```

# Running

To start a dev server at `localhost:3000` run: 

```
npm start
```

# Step by step instruction

Git repository of this project contains tags for every video in the tutorial so
that it's really easy to follow with what happened, where and why.

## OK, but how can I use that ?

### See all tags

Run `git tag` for list of all available tags

### Checkout repo at tag

Run `git checkout <tagname>` to move your current branch to a state at specified
tag. 

### Checking what you're missing

Run `git diff <tagname>` to see how is your current state of the repo different
from the `tagname` state.
